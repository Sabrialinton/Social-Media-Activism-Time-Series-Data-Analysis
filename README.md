### Social Media Activism Time-Series Data Analysis

#### Overview
This project presents a longitudinal time-series analysis of large-scale Twitter datasets to examine engagement patterns related to social activism movements. The objective was to identify temporal trends and evaluate correlations between digital engagement and real-world events.

#### Technical Focus Areas
- Time-Series Analysis
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Statistical Trend Evaluation
- Data Visualization (Python)

#### Methodology
Using Python-based data analysis tools, multi-year Twitter engagement datasets were processed and analyzed. Metrics such as tweet volume and hashtag frequency were examined to identify statistically significant spikes and recurring trends.

Temporal patterns were compared against known real-world events to evaluate potential correlations between digital discourse and societal developments.

#### Key Findings
- Engagement spikes aligned with major real-world events.
- Social media activity demonstrated measurable event-driven behavior.
- Longitudinal analysis revealed recurring engagement cycles over time.
